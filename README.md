## 📌 Problem Statement
Cities face numerous civic issues like *potholes, broken streetlights, water leakage, and garbage accumulation.* Authorities often struggle to prioritize which complaints to resolve first due to limited resources, leading to **delayed responses** and **inefficient issue management**.

---

## 💡 Solution: UrbanEye
UrbanEye is a *Flask & Node.js-powered civic issue prioritization system* that leverages *Machine Learning* to classify and rank civic complaints based on *severity* and *public sentiment*.

### 🔑 Key Features
- 🚦 **Automated Complaint Prioritization**: ML models rank complaints by severity.
- 😠 **Sentiment Analysis**: Understands urgency through public sentiment.
- 📊 **Real-time Data Processing**: Fetches and processes complaints dynamically.
- 🔗 **Seamless Integration**: Works with **MongoDB, Flask, and Node.js**.

## 🧠 ML Model Details
UrbanEye's core strength lies in its *Machine Learning models*, which:
1. **Understand Complaints**: Classify issues like potholes, garbage, and water leaks.
2. **Analyze Sentiment**: Detect emotions like frustration or anger in complaint text.
3. **Predict Severity**: Assign severity scores using historical data.
4. **Rank Issues**: Sort complaints by urgency for efficient resolution.

### 🛠 Models Used
| Model                  | Purpose                    | Technology       |
|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Users** submit complaints via the frontend.
2. The **Node.js server** handles authentication and sends data to **MongoDB**.
3. The **Flask server** processes complaints, applies ML models, and assigns severity scores.
4. The **priority list** is displayed on the frontend for authorities to act upon.
